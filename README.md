# Beyond

A JavaScript and TypeScript runtime built on [Luminous](https://github.com/notwindstone/luminous),
the ahead-of-time TypeScript compiler: a program and the runtime's own APIs are
compiled together into one native executable.

## Plan

The first milestone is the web-interoperable (WinterTC) globals and an HTTP
server, measured against `Bun.serve`:

- `URL` / `URLSearchParams`, `TextEncoder` / `TextDecoder`, `Headers`,
  `Request` / `Response`, timers, `AbortController` / `AbortSignal`,
  `Event` / `EventTarget`, `crypto.getRandomValues`, `structuredClone`;
- `Beyond.serve`, an HTTP/1.1 server.

How it is built, following [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun) (see
[NOTICE](NOTICE)):

1. The socket and HTTP layer is Bun's fork of uSockets and uWebSockets
   (Apache 2.0), as is: what makes `Bun.serve` fast does not depend on the
   JavaScript engine.
2. The logic of Bun's Rust implementations (request and response bodies,
   headers, the server's request handling, text encoding) is ported to the
   engine Luminous uses (QuickJS-NG): Bun's code is written against
   JavaScriptCore.
3. `URL`, `Event` / `EventTarget` and `AbortController` are written anew in
   TypeScript, compiled by Luminous with the program (Bun's are WebKit's
   WebCore, LGPL).
4. Text encoding uses simdutf (Apache 2.0), as Bun does.

The native core is Rust (a static library with a C interface, linked into
each program), with uSockets and uWebSockets as C and C++.

## Building

```sh
scripts/setup.sh          # Luminous (a submodule) and its engine
cargo build --release
target/release/beyond run app.ts
```

`beyond build app.ts -o app` writes the executable. Needs clang (Bun's
networking code uses its extensions) and zlib.

## Status

- Timers: `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `clearTimeout`, `clearInterval`, with
  `Timeout` objects (`ref`, `unref`, `refresh`), as Bun's; `performance.now`.
  The event loop waits on uSockets' until the next timer is due, as Bun's
  does, and runs the jobs callbacks queue in between.
- `Beyond.serve({ port, hostname, fetch, error })`, as `Bun.serve`: HTTP/1.1
  on Bun's uSockets and uWebSockets, keep-alive and pipelining included. The
  `fetch` handler returns a `Response` or a promise of one; request bodies
  are read whole before it runs. `server.port`, `server.url`, `server.stop()`.
- `Blob`, `File` and `FormData`; bodies of them, of strings, bytes and
  `URLSearchParams` (multipart/form-data written and read, urlencoded
  read: `formData()`, `blob()`), with their content types as Bun gives them.
- `Headers`, `Request` and `Response` as the Fetch standard has them, with
  string and byte bodies (`text`, `json`, `arrayBuffer`, `bytes`;
  `Response.json`, `Response.redirect`, `Response.error`). Written in
  TypeScript that Luminous compiles to native code: the classes keep their
  state in plain fields (not `#private` ones) and check header names and
  values without regular expressions, so that every constructor and method
  on a request's path is native. A response's headers are made only when the
  program reads them; most responses only send a content type.

- `URL` and `URLSearchParams`: the URL standard's parser (a state machine,
  with a fast path for the common URL), hosts with IPv4, IPv6 and
  internationalized domains (punycode, and UTS #46's mapping approximated
  with NFKC, lower case and the Unicode categories), all the setters. It
  passes all of the web platform tests' URL data (urltestdata 896/896,
  setters 278/278, toascii 87/87; Bun: 881, 274 and 80) and 2626 of the
  2634 IdnaTestV2 cases (Bun: 1867).
- `TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder`: UTF-8 (native: Rust's validation and its
  lossy decoding, which is the standard's), UTF-16LE/BE and windows-1252
  (the standard's `latin1` and `ascii`), `fatal`, `ignoreBOM` and streaming.
- `Event`, `CustomEvent`, `EventTarget` (capture, `once`, `passive`,
  `signal`, `handleEvent` objects), `AbortController` and `AbortSignal`
  (`abort`, `timeout`, `any`, `onabort`), `reportError` (as Bun's: the error
  is printed and the program exits with 1 after the current task).
- `console`, formatting values as Bun does (its formatter's rules, ported:
  objects one property a line, arrays on one line until 80 columns, quoted
  strings inside values, `[Object ...]` past depth 2, `[Circular]`, class
  names, Map/Set/typed arrays/promises, `%s %d %i %f %o %O %j %c`), and
  Beyond's classes print as Bun's do; `group`, `count`, `time`, `assert`,
  `trace`; `Beyond.inspect`. Standard output is buffered (flushed before
  the event loop waits, before standard error is written, and at exit).
- `crypto.getRandomValues` and `crypto.randomUUID` (from the kernel, through
  a buffer), `structuredClone` (with `transfer`), `self`; and from
  QuickJS-NG, `queueMicrotask`, `atob`, `btoa`, `DOMException`.

The tests (`cargo test`) run programs whose output must be Bun's, the WPT
URL data, and a server answering over TCP.

Not yet: TLS, HTTP/2, WebSockets, streams (and streaming bodies), `fetch`
(the client), `crypto.subtle`; errors print without Bun's source
excerpt, and their stacks' lines are the bundle's.

## Performance

`Beyond.serve` against `Bun.serve` (Bun 1.4.2), the same program
(`Response("Hello World!")` and `Response.json({...})`), 10 seconds of
`oha -c 50` on the same 4-core machine as the server:

| | requests/s | p99 latency | peak memory |
|---|---|---|---|
| Beyond, text | 68,038 | 1.71 ms | 16.0 MB |
| Bun, text | 68,210 | 1.90 ms | 27.2 MB |
| Beyond, JSON | 65,326 | 1.73 ms | 16.4 MB |
| Bun, JSON | 62,324 | 2.08 ms | 28.3 MB |

Throughput is level with Bun's for text and ahead for JSON (the load
generator shares the cores), in about 60% of the memory. Before the request path compiled to native code
(with `#private` fields and regular expressions in `Headers`), Beyond
answered 37,661 text and 25,350 JSON requests a second.
